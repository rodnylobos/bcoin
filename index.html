While it is still considered a new technology by the mainstream, it has been around for a few years now.</h2>

<p>Since then, there have been many variants. One of the most innovative projects that is gaining traction is the open source Ethereum project, founded by Vitalik Buterin: <code>https://github.com/ethereum/</code></p>

<p>Ethereum brings the ability to create programmable transactions or ‘smart contracts’. While smart contracts are not a new idea, original cryptocurrencies like the Bitcoin were not designed to create complex program logic. Often, ideas for smart contracts over existing crypto-currency networks have relied on creative work-arounds and hacks. Ethereum was developed first and foremost with smart contracts in mind. <code>https://www.quora.com/What-should-everyone-know-about-Ethereum</code></p>

<p>As Ethereum is evolving, so is the documentation. This means that it is sometimes missing or difficult to find. Often the answers are found in different sites and forums. We created this document to summarize our findings in one place.</p>

<p>In time, we hope that this document will help anyone new to the blockchain reach a level of competence and eventually come up with their own innovative smart contracts, which will benefit everyone. </p>
